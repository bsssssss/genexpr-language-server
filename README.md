# genexpr-language-server

This is a very embryonic implementation of a language server for Cycling 74's
GenExpr language.

I wanted a way to write genexpr code in neovim so I started making this, it is
also a good way to learn more about LSPs and programming in Typescript.

For now there is just a working connection and a bit of semantic typing.
